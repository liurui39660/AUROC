= AUROC
Rui LIU (@liurui39660)

Header-only AUROC/ROC-AUC in C++11

== Usage

. Include `include/AUROC.hpp`
. Call `AUROC(yTrue, yPred, n)` and get the result

== Requirement

C++11 and standard libraries

== Arguments

* `T` (template): Type of array elements, should be a floating number type
* `yTrue`: Array of ground truth labels, 0 is negative, 1 is positive
* `yPred`: Array of predicted scores, can be of any range
* `n`: Number of elements in the array
* Return: AUROC/ROC-AUC score, range [0.0, 1.0]

== Q&A

[qanda]

How fast is it?::
On my desktop PC, ~1.35s for ~8M records. +
The only `sort` takes ~80% of the running time.

How accurate is it?::
From tests and my daily usage, the difference with `sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score` is mostly less than 1e-15.

Where are the test code and data?::
I didn't upload them to GitHub.

Why not using plain C?::
`qsort` array index might be very tedious. +
Otherwise, C11 is required for the additional argument passed to the comparison function.
