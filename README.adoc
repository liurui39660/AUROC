= AUROC

Header-only AUROC/ROC-AUC in C++11

== Usage

. Copy `AUROC.hpp` to where you need
. Include `AUROC.hpp`
. Call `AUROC(yTrue, yPred, n)` and get result

== Requirement

C++11 (because of template)

== Argument

* `T` (template): Type of array elements, should be a floating number type
* `yTrue`: Array of ground truth labels, 0.0 is negative, 1.0 is positive
* `yPred`: Array of predicted scores, can be of any range
* `n`: Number of elements in the array
* Return: AUROC/ROC-AUC score, range [0.0, 1.0]

== FAQ

[qanda]
How fast is it?::
On my desktop PC, ~1.35s for ~8M records

How accurate is it?::
Use cmake to compile and run `Test.cpp` to compare with `sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score`, the difference is mostly less than 1e-8

Why not using plain C?::
`qsort` array index might be very tedious; otherwise, C11 is required for the additional argument passed to the comparison function
