= AUROC

AUROC/ROC-AUC in C++11

== Usage

. Copy `AUROC.hpp` to where you need
. Include `AUROC.hpp`
. Call `AUROC(y_true, y_pred, n)` and get result

== Requirement

C++11 (because of template)

== Argument

* `y_true`: Array of ground truth, negative is 0.0, positive is 1.0
* `y_pred`: Array of prediction, arbitrary range
* `n`: Array length, can be smaller than the actual size

== FAQ

How fast is it?::
On my desktop PC, ~1.35s for ~8M records
How accurate is it?::
    Use cmake to compile and run `Test.cpp` to compare with `sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score`, the difference is mostly less than 1e-8
Why not using plain C?::
    `qsort` array index might be very tedious; otherwise, C11 is required for the additional argument passed to the comparison function
